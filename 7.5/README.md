## 题目：

> Follow up for "Unique Paths":
  Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
  An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
  
> For example,
  There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.
  
  


> [
     [0,0,0],
     [0,1,0],
     [0,0,0]
   ]
